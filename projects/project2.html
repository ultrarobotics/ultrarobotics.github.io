      <h4>Hobby Quadruped Project</h4>
      <p>
        This project was hobby project from the end of my Bachelor's to the start of my Master's. I developed a torque-controlled quadruped robot from scratch, gaining hands-on experience in mechanical design, electrical integration, and software development.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mechanical Design:</strong>
          <ul class="sub-bullet">
            <li>Selected components like bearings, belts, motors, and motor drivers to meet constraints and requirements.</li>
            <li>Designed lightweight, backdriveable gearboxes using a double-stage belt reduction.</li>
            <li>Addressed challenges like cable management and space constraints for the robot's electronics.</li>
            <li>Used SolidWorks for a full CAD model of the robot.</li>
            <li>Fabricated components using a Creality CR-10 3D printer and tested prototypes for durability.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Electrical Integration:</strong>
          <ul class="sub-bullet">
            <li>Experimented with ST's motor driver developer kit and SimpleFOC before choosing for an out-of-the-box solution.</li>
            <li>Integrated ODrives with AMT encoders and controlled them via Raspberry Pi 4 with a CAN shield.</li>
            <li>Designed the circuit with safety measures such as inrush current protection and ground loop prevention.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Software Development:</strong>
          <ul class="sub-bullet">
            <li>Converted the robotâ€™s CAD design from SolidWorks to URDF and MJCF formats for simulation.</li>
            <li>Created a simulation environment to verify walking gaits and programmed C++ code for inverse kinematics and trajectory generation.</li>
            <li>Used Ubuntu and ROS 2 on Raspberry Pi, developing custom and existing nodes for functionality.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
