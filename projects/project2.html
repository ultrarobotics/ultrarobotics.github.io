      <h4>Hobby Quadruped Project</h4>
      <p class="project-date">Duration: February 2021 – July 2023</p>
      <p>
        Through this project, I built a <strong>torque-controlled quadruped from scratch</strong>, gaining hands-on experience in <strong>mechanical design, electrical integration, and software development</strong>. This experience not only deepened my understanding of legged locomotion but also laid the foundation for my later research in the co-design of legged robots.

      <h5>Hardware Development: Designing and Building the Robot</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Defined platform requirements, focusing on backdriveability, modularity, and cost-efficiency.</li>
        <li>Designed a <strong>double-stage belt reduction gearbox</strong> to minimize backlash and reduce weight, integrating the gearbox seamlessly into each subcomponent of the robot.</li>
        <li>Worked out the mechanical design in <strong>SolidWorks</strong>.</li>
        <li>Fabricated parts using a <strong>Creality CR-10 3D printer</strong> and iterated designs based on durability and manufacturability testing.</li>
        <li>Addressed key design challenges such as <strong>cable management and spatial constraints</strong> for the embedded electronics.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h5>Electrical System: Integration & Power Management</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Explored different motor driver solutions, testing <strong>ST’s developer kit and SimpleFOC</strong>.</li>
        <li>Integrated <strong>ODrive motor controllers</strong> with AMT encoders for precise torque control.</li>
        <li>Designed and implemented a safe and robust electrical system, incorporating <strong>inrush current protection and ground loop prevention</strong>.</li>
        <li>Established a CAN-based communication protocol between the computer and motor controllers for efficient real-time control.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h5>Software Development: Control and Simulation</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Converted the CAD model from <strong>SolidWorks → URDF → MJCF</strong> for use in simulation environments.</li>
        <li>Developed an inverse kinematics solver and trajectory generation algorithms in <strong>C++</strong> to control leg movements.</li>
        <li>Built a <strong>custom ROS 2 stack</strong> for high-level robot control running on the Raspberry Pi 4.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h5>Results & Insights</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Successfully created a working, compliant quadruped robot capable of basic walking.</strong></li>
      </ul>
